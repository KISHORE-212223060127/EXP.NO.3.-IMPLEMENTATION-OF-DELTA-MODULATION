# EXP.NO.3.-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-DELTA-MODULATION

3.Implementation of Delta Modulation 
  
## AIM    
 To study the Delta modulation using the Delta Modulation trainer kit. 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED
Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V)   
## PROCEDURE

 1. Connect the Delta Modulation Trainer Kit to the Power Supply (0â€“30 V) andswitch it ON.
 2. Make the connections as per the block diagram provided on the trainer board:
 3. Connect the input signal to the comparator.
 4. Connect the comparator output to the sampler.
 5. Connect the sampler output to the integrator and quantizer.
 6. Connect the demodulation path: from the digital output to the integrator, then to the low-pass filter, and finally to the output stage.
 7. Using patch cords, connect various output points to the CRO (Cathode Ray Oscilloscope).
 8. Observe and analyze the following waveforms on the CRO:
 - Input Signal
 - Integrator 1 Output
 - Sampler Output
 - Integrator 3 Output
 - Filter Output
 - Demodulated Output  
 9. Measure the amplitude and time period of each waveform using the CRO settings.
 10. Record the measured values in the observation table.
 11. Plot the waveforms on a graph sheet using suitable scales.
